Hi,

NOTE: Front-End was from John Smilga of Coding Addict.

Code is publicly available to his students.


I worked on setting up the backend REST API (with testing via postman)& MongoDB -(MVC).
I also set up the middleware, env file for secure mongodb access, the error handling part of the application, plus the deployment to fly.io.
